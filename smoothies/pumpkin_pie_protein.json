    "name": "Pumpkin Pie Protein Smoothie",
    "description": "Pumpkin pie gets a bad rap because of calorie-laden cream and sugar that’s added to it. But you can still get that sweet, whipped taste without falling off the wagon. Pumpkin is high in fiber, antioxidants and immunity-boosting nutrients — including iron, vitamin A and vitamin E — so we had no issue with loading up our vanilla smoothie recipe with lots of pumpkin and spices. One glass has 27 grams of protein. Flu season is around the corner, so whip out the blender and drink up for good health!",
